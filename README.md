# Advent of Code 2024

This year I will be using Rust to write the solutions to advent of code.
Solutions can be ran on your own inputs by going into each day's specific directory `d#` and running `cargo run --bin p1 < input.txt` with `p1` or `p2` for the respective parts. You must provide `input.txt` yourselves.
